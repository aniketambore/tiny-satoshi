# Tiny Satoshi

A 2D RPG game designed to make Bitcoin self-custody education fun and engaging for beginners and kids. Created for the Bitcoin++ 2025 Virtual hackathon.

## üéÆ About the Game

Tiny Satoshi is an educational 2D RPG game that aims to solve a critical problem in the Bitcoin ecosystem: the lack of accessible education about self-custody. Many newcomers to Bitcoin often turn to custodial solutions due to the perceived complexity of self-custody, which goes against Bitcoin's ethos of financial sovereignty.

Through an engaging game environment, players learn essential self-custody concepts by:

- Creating and managing their own Bitcoin wallet
- Understanding the importance of secure mnemonic phrase storage
- Validating their mnemonic phrases
- Receiving and sending testnet bitcoins
- Learning about Bitcoin's key concepts through interactive quests

## üéØ Mission

My mission is to make Bitcoin self-custody education:

- Fun and engaging
- Accessible to beginners and kids
- Interactive and practical
- Free from technical jargon
- Focused on security best practices

This project was created as part of the Bitcoin++ 2025 Virtual hackathon, with the goal of contributing to the Bitcoin ecosystem by making self-custody education more accessible and engaging for newcomers.
